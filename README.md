# End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Cloud Deployment

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning system, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment on the cloud. It includes a Flask web application for real-time predictions and CI/CD integration for automated deployment.

## üöÄ Features
- Modular project structure with logging and exception handling
- Data ingestion, transformation, and feature engineering
- Model training with Scikit-learn, CatBoost, and XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
- Flask-based prediction API
- Deployment on **AWS** using CI/CD pipelines (GitHub + AWS EC2)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages/Frameworks:** Python, Flask  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Dill  
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, AWS EC2, CI/CD Pipelines
